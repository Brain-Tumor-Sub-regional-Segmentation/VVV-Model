# VVV-Model
 - Given the superior performance of the `V-Net Model` compared to other models we tested—primarily due to issues like overfitting or the extensive training epochs required for transformers—we decided to enhance the V-Net Model further. Our goal was to address the challenges present in the original V-Net architecture by modifying the model's structure.

- We have deployed the model, which you can find on Hugging Face</a><a href="https://huggingface.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
